Worley pattern ideas:

To split up rooms, distribute n means through the map
	now, run a series of steps with randomized BFS (shuffle the queue every time?) for each mean.
	a mean "claims" the territory that it searches - one mean cannot claim territory already claimed by another mean
	keep going until all available territory has been claimed.

How to decide on value of n?


This technique might also be able to create a partition of the map for deciding what 'aesthetic area' each room is in!


Want to generate:

Abstract
- Rooms with two discontiguous paths (Green Brinstar Entrance) (connected with hidden passage)
- Drop you into an old room with one-way?
- Tantalizing Item display (with access from another room)
- Hidden T-junction
- Hidden "Sectors", where all in-out connections are hidden?
- A "Speed Section" through which you can maintain a speedboost across multiple rooms?

Concrete
- Zebbo farm with pits
- Grapple Beam over Water
- Spike Floor
- Standing and Sitting Chozo Statues
- Map Rooms
- Little plants! + Hanging Vines
- Evolving tile schema / aesthetic within a split room (?)
- Surface Irregularities (stalactites, etc.)
- Little Pockets / Dead Ends?
- Ripper Tunnel (Ice Beam)
- Sand Falls
- Grapple Beam Walls
- Shot Block Maze?
- Spike Platforms?
- Sand Pits
- Danger Above and Below (crateria power bombs)
- Cavy backgrounds (crateria keyhunters)
- Water -> Eroded tiles
- Space Fleas
- Hidden Ceiling Stuff
- Smooth surfaces (let them use speed booster!)
- Crateria Mushrooms (branching mushrooms??)
- Hidden "looky-eyes"
- Running Crumble Floors
- "Nontraditional" enemy farms (geemers, rippers, etc.)
- "Out of place" enemies - ex Pink Brinstar E-Tank
- Yapping Maws with Spikes / Acid!
- Floor "textures"?
- Cave-like versus Straight versus Sand-like ?
	-> Different "processes"
		-> generate a cave, then "structures" ex. lower norfair.
- Respawning Drillbats
- Wasteland Horizontal Spikes!
- Powered on vs. off Wrecked Ship

Level Design
- Pits & Platforms
- Space Jump to travel to the ceiling of big rooms
- Box with Platforms
	- Shaft with Platforms...
- Bowl + Platform
	- Maridia sand + Crateria Keyhunters
- Multiple Paths through the room to get to the same point
	- Platform challenges with failure, but also just paths...
- Morph Ball Only maze
- Grapple / Wall Jump shaft
- Platform Stairs
- Generalized "climb room"
- Zigzag Climb
- "General" platforms
- Combinations of these things for big rooms...
- "Minirooms" (Green Hill Zone, Red Tower)!!
- "Wide Passage" - It's fine for a map tile to be mostly empty...
- Minirooms separated by shot blocks (or X blocks...)
- Minirooms separated by tunnels / morph ball tunnels.
- Space Jump Spike Maze
- Room "Motifs" as well as Aesthetic Motifs
- "Extended" Pits & Platforms (Cathedral)
- Morph Ball Minirooms that can be long and thin.
- Big rooms with big minirooms (Grapple Yump)
	- Can dedicate one miniroom to building a shinespark and the next to using it!
- Different minirooms can have different styles! (Bubble Mountain / Big Pink)
	- speckledy transitions (Single Chamber)
- Allow single minirooms (Rising Tide)
- Minirooms can help define where scroll PLMs should be!
- Minirooms do not have to have walls all the way around
- Do not have to partition the entire space either.
	
Art
- Draygon Room as an aesthetic?
- Save Room / Map Room as an aesthetic?
- Golden Statues Room as an aesthetic?
- Statues Tunnel as an aesthetic?

Cell Automaton -> Generate cave walls
+ Add Pipes and stuff?

3-square jump height underwater no gravity

TODO:
Add item sets  to the abstract graph
Add fixed areas to the cmap instead of just nodes
Adding other item nodes to the abstract map
use (bfs_dist / euclidean dist) to create new paths

Use patterns to recognize tiling errors?

Randomize Samus Palette?
Black/Red-paletted enemies that instakill?
Update to heapdict instead of heapq
