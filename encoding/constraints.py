# Creates a MinSetSet from a constraint.
# Expects constraints with the following recursive syntax:
# Symbol () () ...
# A         requires A
# & A B C   requires all of A, B, C
# | A B C   requires any of A, B, C
# where () denotes a constraint surrounded by parens
# NOT IMPLEMENTED - 
# !()       Logical NOT of the expression
# the reason for this is evident in the structure of Super Metroid - since you
# can always turn every item off, there is no reason for an edge to ever require
# you not to have an item.
